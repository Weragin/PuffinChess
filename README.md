# Chess-bot
This engine is a project made by Michael Ruman and Peter Popluhár.\
It is a part of SOČ (Stredoškolská odborná činnosť, which roughly translates \
to High School Scholarly Activity) which is a high school competition \
with a self-explanatory name. 

# Usage with CL
In order to use the engine in command line mode, all you need is to download \
the executable file called PuffinChess (.exe for Win, no suffix for Linux). \
Upon running, the executable file opens a command line interface. \
The engine communicates using the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol.

# Usage with GUI
To connect the program to a graphical interface download the executable \
and a GUI of your liking (e.g. the [XBoard](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/)) and give the location of executable \
to your GUI. Each GUI is different, therefore follow the instructions for you GUI of choice.
